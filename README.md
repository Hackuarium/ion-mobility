# What is Ion Mobility Spectrometry ?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion-mobility_spectrometry]



# Why should we do this ?

There are numerous application for IMS and it has the main advantage to work at atmospheric pressure (in constraste with mass spectrometry that requires most of the time 10-3 torr) that would make it compact and affordable.

As for hackuarium and I could see the possibility to make continious monitoring of bioreactor.

# Can we do a Ion Mobility Spectrometer our self ?

Main parts of the IMS :

- Ionization
- Shutter
- Acceleration
- Detection
