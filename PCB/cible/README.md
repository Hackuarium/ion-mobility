# Target/Cible

## Description

Target at the end of the IMS/Drift tube, on which the ions will collide and create a small current. Is situated after the drift tube and before the amplification.

The target is a [Faraday plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cup) used to catch the ions and analyze them afterwards.

## Specifications and limitations

The target has to be surrounded by a ground connected ring with small holes to inject a drift gas. It is connected on its back side to the amplifier to transform the ion current into a readable voltage.

## PCB

Below are pictures of the target PCB.
